# Bad Actor --- Pathvector Bogon config for V6.3.0 and up
## "Crowdsourced Internet asshole and criminal removal"
This repository contains a list of known bad actors for which you can utilize in a Pathvector.io bogons list. 

Add and/or delete entries you think are wrong, and submit a pull request for review.

`blocklist-for-pathvector.txt` accepts both ASN and prefix entries, while `bogon-asns.yaml` only accepts ASN entries. If adding an ASN entry to either of these files, please add an 
equivalent entry to the other file. Please keep this in mind when contributing to ensure nothing gets missed.
